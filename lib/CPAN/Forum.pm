=head1 NAME

CPAN::Forum - Web forum application to discuss CPAN modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Visit L<http://cpanforum.com/>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Web forum application specifically designed to be used for
discussing CPAN modules. At one point it might be adapted to be a general
forum software but for now it is released in the hope that people
will help improving it and by that improving the 
L<http://cpanforum.com/> site.

=head2 Features

=over 4 

=item * Posting only by authenticated users.

=item * For registration a valid e-mail is required.

=item * Username and password should be in lowercase and unique.

=item * Every poster will have to give

=over 4

=item 1. name of the group

=item 2. Subject

=item 3. Content

=item 4. (Future) A unique id to the post and the post made in response to.
   
This reference id will be NULL for new posts. At the beginning responses will 
have to maintain group but can change the subject and will have to write new 
text.

=back 

=item * Later we might enable changing the group to a related group.

(e.g. a message about a module can get a response in a group to which this 
module belongs to)

=item * Later we might enable total random change in the groups.

=item * We make sure the links are search-engine friendly

  /dist/Dist-Name/
  /rss/
  /atom/
  
  /posts/ID  (link to a post)
  /threads/ID  (link to a thread)

=item * We provide RSS and Atom feed of the recent posts belonging to any of the groups.

=item * We'll provide search capability with restrictions to groups.

=back

=head1 Authentication

Shared authentication with auth.perl.org? I once tried to do this but then for 
some reason I could not finish the process. Maybe later we'll want to enable 
our users to use their auth.perl.org identity. Maybe we can do it also with 
PerlMonks. Right now we have our own registration and login mechanism.

=head1 INSTALLATION of a development environment

=head2 hosts

For local installations in /etc/hosts I added:

    127.0.0.1         test.cpanforum.local

That way, I can have a totally separate virtual host just for this application.

=head2 PostgreSQL

  $ sudo -u postgres psql postgres
  postgres=# CREATE ROLE forum_test_user LOGIN;
  postgres=# CREATE DATABASE cpanforum_test OWNER = forum_test_user;
  
  $ sudo vi /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf
  
Add:   local all forum_test_user trust

  $ sudo  /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart
 
 Now this should work:
 
   $ psql -U forum_test_user cpanforum_test

=head2 Apache

This is the configuration of my Apache server on my development machine. 
(Actually I have several of these and one of them is using mod_perl2.

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName   test.cpanforum.local
	
    SETENV CPAN_FORUM_LOGFILE /tmp/cpanforum_test.log
    SETENV CPAN_FORUM_DB cpanforum_test
    SETENV CPAN_FORUM_USER forum_test_user

    SETENV CPAN_FORUM_NOMAIL 1
    SETENV CPAN_FORUM_DEV 1

    DocumentRoot /home/gabor/work/cpan-forum/www
    Alias            /img       /home/gabor/work/cpan-forum/www/img
    Alias /pod  /home/gabor/.cpanforum/dist
    AliasMatch ^/dist/(.+/.+) /home/gabor/.cpanforum/dist/$1
    
    ScriptAliasMatch ^/(\w*)$  /home/gabor/work/cpan-forum/www/cgi/index.pl/$1
    ScriptAliasMatch ^/(.*/.*)  /home/gabor/work/cpan-forum/www/cgi/index.pl/$1
    DirectoryIndex              cgi/index.pl
  </VirtualHost>


=head2 Environment variables

in ~/.bashrc I have the following:

   export CPAN_FORUM_LOGFILE=/tmp/cpanforum_gabor.log
   export CPAN_FORUM_TEST_URL=http://test.cpanforum.local/
   export CPAN_FORUM_TEST_DB=cpanforum_test
   export CPAN_FORUM_TEST_USER=forum_test_user

=head2 Install the perl code

=head2 test the code

    perl Build.PL       - and make sure the prerequisites are installed
                          some of the can be installed using    sudo aptitude ...
                          for others I configured local::lib, installed them locally
                          and configured the Apache server to look at that by adding the following
                          to the configuration file of Apache:
              SETENV PERL5LIB /home/gabor/perl5/lib/perl5:/home/gabor/perl5/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi

    ./Build
    ./Build test

    chmod a+x www/cgi/index.pl


=head2 Setup and populate the database

    perl bin/setup.pl 
        --username testadmin              The user name of the administrator used on the web interface
        --email 'test\@perl.org.il'       The E-mail of the administrator.
        --password pw_of_testadmin        The password of the administrator.
        --from 'testforum\@perl.org.il'   The Email address to be used as the from address in the messages sent by the system.

        --dbname $ENV{CPAN_FORUM_DB} 
        --dbuser $ENV{CPAN_FORUM_USER}

You will be able to change all these values later from the web interface but 
we need to have the first values.

    
    perl bin/populate_cpan_forum.pl 
        --dbname $ENV{CPAN_FORUM_DB} 
        --dbuser $ENV{CPAN_FORUM_USER}

This will fetch a file from www.cpan.org and might take a few minutes to run.

=head1 PATH

The path to the root of the unzipped distribution is 
determined automatically by the cgi script or the mod_perl
handle. Path to lib/ and templates/ can be derived from it.

=head2 CPAN_FORUM_LOGFILE

Path to the log file.


=head2 CPAN_FORUM_DEV

Indicate that we are on a development machine. (No Google Analytics or advertisements)

=head2 CPAN_FORUM_TEST_URL

For some of the tests you'll have to set the CPAN_FORUM_TEST_URL environment 
variable to the URL where you installed the forum.

=head2 CPAN_FORUM_NO_MAIL

Turn off mail sending (for testing).


=head1 TODO

See the TODO file

=head1 Description

Subject field:
-  <= 80 chars
-  Can contain any characters, we'll escape them when showing on the web site
 
Text field:
- No restriction on line length, let the HTML handle that part
- The text is divided into areas of free text and marked sections

- Pages:
    new mesage:      EDITOR;          PREVIEW + EDITOR
    show:            POST
    response:        POST + EDITOR;   POST + PREVIEW + EDITOR

    thread:          P1 + P2 + .. Pn
    thread response: P1 + P2 + .. Pn + EDITOR;   \
    P1 + P2 + .. Pn + PREVIEW + EDITOR;

When the EDITOR comes up first the subject should be filled by the subject it
is answering to or empty for new message.
  
The PREVIEW and the EDITOR should be filled by the same information, though
within the editor we don't need the parent id and similar to be shown.


OK, so we have listing in places like

    /
    /dist/Distro-Name
    /users/USERNAME
    
    /all  Can be a name for all the posts so we don't need to put any other 
          information immediately after the first slash  maybe it should be 
          /home ?

    /dist/Distro-Name/start/count
    /all/start/count

    
We'll also have some search facility that will be a post operation and

    /posts/id          show a post      (show post         )
    /new_post/         start new post   (            editor with module list)
    /new_post/Module   start new post   (            editor  no  module list)
    /response_form/id  start a respones (show post + editor)


From the forms we have post methods so no need for URL munging
process_post  =>  (show previous post)? show editor + show preview

=over 4

A user can ask to be notified upon the following events per distribution.
subscriptions: uid, gid, (all), (starter), (participate)
1) All messages 

All the messages execute 
QUERY: select uid FROM subscription WHERE gid == disto and all. 

2) Thread starters
Thread starteres (where id=thread) execute 
QUERY: select uid FROM subscription WHERE gid == distro and starter

3) Followup messages in a thread he participated already
Every message (well, except thread starters) execute:
QUERY: select uid FROM subscription
- there is a post with the same thread id as of this post which was posted by a user which
has a subsciption (participate)


4) People who are not subscribed to All messages (1) when seeing an
interesting posting they can say: send me all followups.  uid, threadid

She can set up such notification on a per module basis or for all the modules.

After logging in the user can modify his "subscriptions" to such notifications.
The notification will be sent out from an e-mail address such as 
noreply@bla.com  which will discard any message sent to it. The message will contain
the text of the post, a link to the post_response page, a link to view the 
whole thread
and an e-mail address in case someone wants to complain/whatever.

=back

- Subscription (notify) management:

- /mypan will be the url to get and set all the configuration information.
It will list all your current subscriptions and you can enable/disable them.
Normally this will show only distributions you have some kind of a subscription.

In addition from /mypan there will be a way to ask to add a new subscription by selecting
the name of a module and the initial subscription parameters to it.

In addition when displaying the list of all the messages to a specific module, logged in users
will see their current subscription to this module (even if that is empty).

=head2 Notification

There is a boolean field on each post called "notified"
When adding a new post we set it to false which is the default value.
There is a daemon that checks the database for posts with "notified"  not TRUE.
Sends the notification messages and sets the bit to true.

=head2 Reset Lost Password

We generate a random string and save the random string as field in the junk table.
The value  will be { rm => 'resetpw', username => $username }  dumped using YAML::Tiny.
We send the random thing by mail to the user attached to a url.

When the user comes with the random string we can fetch the value and go to the 
resetpw run mode that shows a page with two empty password fields 
with the random string in a hidden fields on the page.

When the user submits the new password pair we look-up the random string again 
and check if the run mode is the one the user requested to execute. 
(Actually this is not the same run-mode)
If that's the one we update the password and remove the row from the junk table.

Gives a custom Internal error page.

Maybe this one should also receive the error message and print it to the log file.

See C<notes()> for simple notes.

Print short notification messages to the user.
